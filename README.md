# StatisTik Static
Static-site proof-of-concept for StatisTik, an analytics platform for TikTok, designed to help production managers who oversee multiple TikTok accounts on behalf of their clients. Built on pure HTML, CSS, and JS.

StatisTik Static is part of a BSIT/CS Senior Project at the University of South Florida. Built with my peers David Schiereck, Eddie Roock, and Gilberto Rios.

This proof-of-concept evolved into [statistik-frontend](https://github.com/TraderHowell/statistik-frontend/) and [statistik-backend](https://github.com/HappyGromper/statistik-backend).
